# HOMA CASE STUDY

## Introduction

This repository is a case study developed for Homa Games.

It utilizes Cypress with TypeScript to automate certain non-regression tests.

Since there aren't many tests, they have all been coded within a single Cypress file : ```cypress\e2e\case-study.cy.ts```.

---

## Install

Clone the repository and execute ```npm install```.

No ```.env``` file needed.

---

## Run Cypress

### With UI

```npm run cypress:open```

Then click on ```E2E Testing``` and select a browser.

In the new window, click on ```case-study.cy.ts``` to initiate the tests.

### Headless

Cypress provides the opportunity to launch the tests via the terminal, without launching the UI.

```npm run cypress:run```

You can add ```--browser chrome/firefox/electron``` (choose one) to specify a browser.

---

## Visual Reports

When running Cypress via ```npm run cypress:run```, a report is generated by Mochawesome as follow :

```cypress\reports\html\index.html``` : Open this in a browser to view the report in a more appealing format than the standard output.

```cypress\reports\html\videos``` :  Contains a video file of the performed tests.

## Continuous Integration

As this project is a case study, we are utilizing the free GitHub Actions solution. The report from the most recent merged PR can be found here :
https://github.com/n-germain-work/homa-case-study/actions/runs/5852944994

You can download the artifacts from the page above or directly via this link :  
https://github.com/n-germain-work/homa-case-study/suites/15066821630/artifacts/860445655

After downloading, unzip the file to access the video and the ```index.html```.  
*(If you do not unzip the file, the index.html will display a blank page)*

## Possible Improvements

As mentioned in the PR, GitHub Actions appear to be rather slow, necessitating the use of an arbitrary ```cy.wait(1000)``` to wait for scrolling to complete. It might be preferable to use CircleCI, where processing resources can be adjusted based on your plan.  
*(note : Github Actions took 3 times longer than a recent computer to run our tests)*

Regarding the test robustness, it would be beneficial to implement ```data-cy``` attributes in the HTML to accurately target elements.  
*(Refer to https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices#Selecting-Elements)*
